A cleanroom implementation of the programming exercises from Chapter 2 of Kurose and Ross "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" sixth edition.

The materials required for the exercises are locked behind a paywall and cannot be accessed if you (like me) are using a library copy of the book.
Hence I decided to implement the exercises myself.

How to use
---------

* Fork and clone the github repository
* Create your own solution branch based on the exercises branch with `git checkout -b ${USER}-solutions exercises`.
* Hack away
* If you need tips look at other peoples solutions with e.g. `git show david-solutions:web-server/web-server.py`


A warning
-------

I'm new to socket programming, so it is unlikely that the solutions given here embody any kind of best-practices. If you are writing a "real" application you need to be much more careful!
